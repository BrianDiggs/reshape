Version 1.2 
-----------

* `value_var` argument to `acast` and `dcast` renamed to `value.var` to be
  consistent with other argument names

* Order `NA` factor levels before `(all)` when creating margins

Version 1.1
-----------

* `melt.data.frame` no longer turns characters into factors

* All melt methods gain a `na.rm` and `value.name` arguments - these
  previously were only possessed by `melt.data.frame` (Fixes #5)
