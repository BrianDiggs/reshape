Reshape 0.8.1 (2008-XX-XX) --------------------------
  
Melt

  * character dimension names are processed by type.convert

Cast


  * now depends on the new plyr package for many of the workhorse functions
  
  * stamp function removed - if you were using it, ddply from the plyr package should be uniformly better

  * add.all.combinations argument renamed to drop to be more consistent with other R functions, and should work much more reliably

  * tweaks to cast and recast to make it easier to pass in formulas created elsewhere
  * allow user to specify column used for values, guessing if necessary
  * helpful error message if value column missing when calling cast
  * improve error messages when melt or casting parameters incorrectly specified 
  * by default, treat character and factor variables as id variables (i.e. integer variables no longer default to being id vars)
  * ... now passed on to melt in melt.list (thanks to Charles Naylor)
